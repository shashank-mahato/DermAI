>   ## ✨ Overview
>   **DermAI** is an innovative, AI-powered application by **Team Advitiya** that brings **instant, real-time skin health assessments** through advanced **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Generative AI**. It is built to provide users with accessible, accurate insights on skin conditions, regardless of location.
>
>   ---
>
>   ## 💡 Motivation
>   ### Why Accessible Skin Health Matters
>   - **🔍 Common Skin Diseases**: Millions lack access to dermatologists or immediate skin health guidance.
>   - **⏳ Delayed Diagnoses**: Minor skin issues often escalate without timely intervention.
>   - **💼 Our Solution**: DermAI is a user-friendly app offering skin condition insights and actionable health advice, accessible to anyone, anywhere.
>
>   ---
>
>   ## 🏗️ System Architecture
>   The **core components** of **DermAI**:
>   1. **Frontend Interface** 🎨: Users can upload images of their skin conditions.
>   2. **Backend** ⚙️: Processes images, predicts diseases with ML, and integrates Generative AI for personalized recommendations.
>   3. **Generative AI (Healix)** 🤖: Offers real-time assistance with follow-up health guidance.
>
>   ### 🌐 Platform
>   - **Deployment**: Deployed with **Render**, offering scalable, reliable access across devices.
>   - **Technologies**: Python, Flask, TensorFlow, and more.
>
>   ---
>
>   ## 🧠 Model Architecture
>   ### EfficientNetB0-Powered ML Model
>   - **Base Model**: EfficientNetB0, optimized for mobile and embedded applications.
>   - **Custom Layers**: Added **Squeeze Excitation Layers** to enhance feature extraction and classification accuracy.
>   - **Performance**: Achieved **96.31% validation accuracy** on the skin disease dataset.
>
>   #### Key Features
>   - **🔒 Layer Freezing**: Retains pre-trained knowledge from ImageNet.
>   - **📉 Adaptive Learning Rate**: Balanced for speed and stability.
>   - **💾 Deployment**: Model saved in `.keras`/`.tflite` format for easy reloading and deployment.
>
>   ---
>
>   ## ⚙️ How it Works
>   1. **📸 Image Upload**: Users upload an image of their skin condition.
>   2. **🔍 Prediction**: The ML model processes the image and predicts the disease.
>   3. **💬 Health Guidance**: Healix, the Generative AI assistant, provides tips and follow-up for the diagnosis.
>   4. **💡 Interactive Chat**: Users can ask Healix questions for instant advice on skin care.
>
>   ---
>
>   ## 📊 Data Collection & Training
>   - **Dataset**: 🗂️ Sourced from **MSID Kaggle Dataset**.
>   - **Preprocessing**: 🖼️ Images resized and normalized for optimized model performance.
>   - **Training Techniques**: 🚀 Transfer learning with EfficientNetB0 and manual hyperparameter tuning to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.
>
>   ---
>
>   ## 🎨 User Interface
